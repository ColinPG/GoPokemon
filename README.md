# GoPokemon
Capstone project website.

#About
GoPokemon is a website that allows users to create accounts and build decks of cards. Users can upload images with cards in it, which will be identified by a Python ML script as a valid picture of a card or not, and identifying the card category. Future planned iterations included functionality for identifying exact cards, and expanding to other card types beyond Pokemon.
